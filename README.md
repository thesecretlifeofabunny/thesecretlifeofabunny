## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Learning my nix / nixos setup, design patterns learning. Learning C with practice and THE book.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... dotnet / C# better, design patterns, nix / nixos, and looking to congritbute to oss.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... linux related software or libraries. I have an idea of one C# project I want to learn and contribute to, as well as one rust linux application, or nix documentation. Anything I find a flaw in that I use, and is open sourced, I feel a want to help out when I'm better after learning a bit more first. I will start contributing when I feel more comfortable with the things I wish to contribute to.
